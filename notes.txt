# the first few times you might get an .so error if thats the case run this
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

# then you should be able to run this guy
./render --bvh=../../data/motion/jump_mxm.bvh

# if you want to do ML or use learned networks gotta use this command to lead python
source ../../py_env/bin/activate

# here is an example of loading a network (need CUDA installed and capable GPU)
./render --bvh=../../data/motion/jump_mxm.bvh --ppo=../../network/output/jump_mxm/network-0.data-00000-of-00001 --parametric

# oops i dont need to include absolute or relative paths
./render --bch=jump_mxm.bhv

# I ran one of the pretrained models!
./render --bvh=jump_mxm.bvh --ppo=jump_mxm/network-0
# That is super fun to play with
# Turn up or down the gravity and up or down the energy
# There was a pretty funny one i came up with where he lands so hard he breaks his own back

# Next step is to learn to train models




#### Notes and errors

# It was failing to load this shared object cuda file like below: libcudart.so.11.0
2022-07-30 16:43:55.374119: W tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:60] Could not load dynamic library 'libcudart.so.11.0'; dlerror: libcudart.so.11.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

# So I installed CUDA Toolkit 11.7 from instructions here: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=18.04&target_type=deb_network

# Then it was erroring that I dont have a CUDA device (cuz i was using intel integrated graphics)

# So i installed an nvidia GPU and nvidia drivers and i got it working using the commands above
